# Road Accident - Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Excel)
## Project Objective
This dashboard enables a detailed analysis of road accident casualties, helping identify key patterns and factors, which can be valuable for public safety and transportation policy planning.

## Dataset Used

- <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadallaithi91/road-accident-dataset">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)

- How many total road casualties occurred, and what is the breakdown by severity (fatal, serious, slight)?
- Which vehicle types are most involved in accidents leading to casualties?
- How do casualty trends vary month by month over different years?
- What types of roads and surface conditions are associated with higher casualty numbers?
- Where do most casualties occur (urban vs. rural areas)?
- How do light conditions (daylight vs. dark) affect the number of casualties?
- How can casualty data be filtered by date and location type for focused analysis?

## Process

- Data Collection and Aggregation: Gathering road accident data from reliable sources, with details on casualties, vehicle types, road types, light conditions, etc.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats for consistency.
- Data Segmentation: Categorizing casualties by severity, vehicle type, road type, light condition, and location (urban vs. rural) for more specific insights.
- Time-Series Analysis: Comparing casualty trends over multiple years to identify monthly patterns and year-over-year changes.
- Visualization Design: Creating pie charts, bar charts, and line graphs to represent casualty breakdowns, trends, and other segmented data visually.
- Dashboard Interactivity: Adding filters for accident date and location type, allowing users to dynamically explore specific subsets of data.
