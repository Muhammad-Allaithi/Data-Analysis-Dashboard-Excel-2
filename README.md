# Road Accident - Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Excel)
## Project Objective
This dashboard enables a detailed analysis of road accident casualties, helping identify key patterns and factors, which can be valuable for public safety and transportation policy planning.

## Dataset Used

- <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadallaithi91/road-accident-dataset">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)

- How many total road casualties occurred, and what is the breakdown by severity (fatal, serious, slight)?
- Which vehicle types are most involved in accidents leading to casualties?
- How do casualty trends vary month by month over different years?
- What types of roads and surface conditions are associated with higher casualty numbers?
- Where do most casualties occur (urban vs. rural areas)?
- How do light conditions (daylight vs. dark) affect the number of casualties?
- How can casualty data be filtered by date and location type for focused analysis?

## Process

- Data Collection and Aggregation: Gathering road accident data from reliable sources, with details on casualties, vehicle types, road types, light conditions, etc.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats for consistency.
- Data Segmentation: Categorizing casualties by severity, vehicle type, road type, light condition, and location (urban vs. rural) for more specific insights.
- Time-Series Analysis: Comparing casualty trends over multiple years to identify monthly patterns and year-over-year changes.
- Visualization Design: Creating pie charts, bar charts, and line graphs to represent casualty breakdowns, trends, and other segmented data visually.
- Dashboard Interactivity: Adding filters for accident date and location type, allowing users to dynamically explore specific subsets of data.

## Final Conclusion

The "Road Accident Dashboard" offers a comprehensive, data-driven view of road safety, highlighting key factors that contribute to accident casualties. By analyzing vehicle types, road and lighting conditions, urban versus rural settings, and monthly trends, this dashboard uncovers critical patterns that can guide targeted safety interventions. The insights gained from this analysis support the development of focused strategies—such as urban traffic management, road surface improvements, and seasonal safety campaigns—to reduce casualties and enhance public safety. This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, traffic authorities, and safety advocates in making informed decisions that could save lives on the road.
